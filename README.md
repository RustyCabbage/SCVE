# Ship Catalogue / Variant Editor (SCVE)
 
Provides three out of campaign missions: one that contains a sorted list of all the ships in vanilla, one that contains a sorted list of all the ships added by mods filtered on a per-mod basis, and one that allows custom searches through editing a CSV file. No more relying on modders creating a showcase mission for you!

Other Features:
- Ship filters to avoid spoilers
- Weapon/wing filters so you can also look at only the relevant mod gear (or mod gear + vanilla (or [REDACTED]^2 weapons))
- Perma-modding s-mods in case you want to try out some builds without loading the campaign and doing a bunch of console commands
